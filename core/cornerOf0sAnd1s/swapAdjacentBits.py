"""
You're given an arbitrary 32-bit integer n. Take its binary representation, split bits into it in pairs
(bit number 0 and 1, bit number 2 and 3, etc.) and swap bits in each pair. Then return the result as a decimal number.

Example

For n = 13, the output should be
swapAdjacentBits(n) = 14.

13_10 = 1101_2 ~> {11}{01}_2 ~> 1110_2 = 14_10.

For n = 74, the output should be
swapAdjacentBits(n) = 133.

74_10 = 01001010_2 ~> {01}{00}{10}{10}_2 ~> 10000101_2 = 133_10.
Note the preceding zero written in front of the initial number: since both numbers are 32-bit integers, they have
32 bits in their binary representation. The preceding zeros in other cases don't matter, so they are omitted.
Here, however, it does make a difference.
