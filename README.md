# Codefights Coding Challenges:
**My solutions to codefights tasks**

## General Information
problems are from https://codefights.com/

In general, all code is preceded by the problem description found on codefights.  It also contains the listed examples.  When applicable, it may also include the input constraints (usually when the code will only work under the given input constraints).
Usually, because I finish the problem in one sitting, I do not comment the code.  The comments found in the code are generally older attempts that I had tried that did not work out, but I kept to base new snippets of code on.
## The Core
Most tasks are done in python 3, however a select few are done in C# and C++ while a few in the beginning are done in Ruby.
Those tasks done in C# are ones which I based my code off of others' solutions.  In other words, most of the code written in a .cs file is not my own.

## Databases
Unlike the other categories, the leading comments found at the beginning of the code do not contain examples of the problem.  This is to avoid confusing formatting issues that would make the problem difficult to read (similar to how any pictures are ommitted from the comments).  However, the problem description is preserved.
