# codefights
My solutions to codefights tasks

Most tasks are done in python 3, however a select few are done in C# and C++ while a few a the beginning are done in Ruby.
Those tasks done in C# are ones which I based my code off of others' solutions.  In other words, most of the code written in a .cs file is not my own.
