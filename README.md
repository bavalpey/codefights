# Codefights Coding Challenges:
https://codefights.com/ 

**My solutions to codefights tasks**

## Core
Most tasks are done in python 3, however a select few are done in C# and C++ while a few a the beginning are done in Ruby.
Those tasks done in C# are ones which I based my code off of others' solutions.  In other words, most of the code written in a .cs file is not my own.

## Databases
Because of the nature of the problems, the examples found on codefights are ommitted to prevent formatting issues. The problem's description is preserved, however.
