"""
Jane just got a letter from her friend and realized that something's wrong: some words in the letter are written twice in a row. The
thing is, she and her friend devised an ingenious cypher, the key to which is the number of pairs of repeated words in the encoded text.
The cases of the words don't matter.

Formally, a word is a substring of letter consisting of English letters, such that characters to the left of the leftmost letter and to
the right of the rightmost letter are not letters.

For obvious reasons, Jane can't tell you how the encryption works, but she needs your help with calculating the number of pairs of
consecutive equal words. Write a function that, given a letter, returns this number.

Example
For letter = "Hi, hi Jane! I'm so. So glad to to finally be able to write - WRITE!! - to you!",
the output should be
  repetitionEncryption(letter) = 4.

There are 4 pairs of consecutive identical words in the text. They are shown in different colors below:
  "Hi, hi Jane! I'm so. So glad to to finally be able to write - WRITE!! - to you!"

def repetitionEncryption(letter):
    pattern = r"(?P<s1>[a-z]+)[^a-z]+(?P=s1)(?:$|[^a-z])"
    regex = re.compile(pattern,re.I)
    return len(re.findall(regex, letter))
