/*
You really love counting stuff. In fact, right now you're sitting on a meadow and counting all the legs you see there! There are some
people, some dogs, and some cats on the meadow. You're pretty confident that each human has 2 legs and that cats and dogs have 4 legs
each.

The information about all the creatures on the meadow is stored in the table creatures. It has the following structure:
  id: the unique creature ID;
  name: the creature's name;
  type: the creature's type - "human", "cat", or "dog". This column has ENUM type.
  
You want to calculate the total number of legs in the meadow. Given the table creatures, build a new table that only contains one column
summary_legs and has only one row with the total number of legs that you can see.

DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS legsCount;
CREATE PROCEDURE legsCount()
    SELECT (SUM(if(type='human',2,4))) as summary_legs
    FROM creatures
    ORDER BY id;
